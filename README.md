Long-term archive for "An Item Response Theory Evaluation of aLanguage-Independent CS1 Knowledge Assessment" (Xie et al. SIGCSE 2018). Anything in this repository should live here forever, but may not be actively maintained.

This archive contains code used to conduct the analysis, example data files, and figures related to distractor analysis that could not fit in the paper.

See README.pdf for more information on this archive and this paper as a whole.
